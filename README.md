⚡ Electronics Engineer | 🖥️ Verilog HDL | 🛠️ Digital System Design | 🔗 FPGA/ASIC Development

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an Electronics Engineer specializing in digital hardware design, with expertise in Verilog HDL, system-on-chip (SoC) development, and FPGA/ASIC implementation. My work revolves around creating efficient, scalable, and high-performance hardware solutions for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to large-scale digital architectures.

I have hands-on experience with Verilog-based system design, covering everything from basic circuit design (logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers) to complex system architectures (processors, memory management, controllers). My projects often involve integrating communication protocols like SPI, UART, and I2C into designs, ensuring seamless interfacing between components.

I am passionate about innovation in hardware engineering and continuously seek to refine my skills in VLSI design, low-power optimization, and high-speed digital systems. Here, you’ll find various projects, code samples, and contributions that demonstrate my ability to take ideas from concept to realization through rigorous testing and verification.

Let’s collaborate and build the future of digital hardware together! 🚀
